# ICSpore DCA protocol

## Description:

With this project you can create an executable DCA financial strategy in IC (Internet Computer) ecosystem.


## Workflow schema
![DCA_Schema](https://salmon-bitter-gull-231.mypinata.cloud/ipfs/QmaUQsLC6XmLfnRxXUmGUv924u3T511BJmGBy5NWYpMzRe)


## Limitations:

* Token for sell - ICP
* Token to buy - ckBTC 


## Prerequisites:

* Some [ICP coin](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/internet-computer/) on your Principal-id  


## Mainnet interactions

| Canister type | Canister id | Stage |
|---------------|-------------|-------|
| DCA backend   | up2ak-nqaaa-aaaap-qccia-cai | Open beta |
| DCA frontend   | qnoqa-vaaaa-aaaap-qhima-cai | Open beta |


### Step 1. Set Approve to DCA canister

This call make future transfer from your wallet possible without any additional actions

```bash
dfx canister call ryjl3-tyaaa-aaaaa-aaaba-cai  icrc2_approve '(record { amount = 40_000; spender = record{owner = principal "up2ak-nqaaa-aaaap-qccia-cai";} })' --ic
```

CLI result
```
(variant { Ok = 12_141_598 : nat })
```

### Step 2. Creating a DCA strategy for swaping ICP to ckBTC


**beneficiary** change this valuse to your principal id who will receive swap result

**tokenToSell** ryjl3-tyaaa-aaaaa-aaaba-cai - its [ICP  Canister ID](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/canister/ryjl3-tyaaa-aaaaa-aaaba-cai)

**tokenToBuy** mxzaz-hqaaa-aaaar-qaada-cai - its 
[ckBTC Canister ID](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/canister/mxzaz-hqaaa-aaaar-qaada-cai)

**frequency** - one of (Daily, Weekly, Monthly)



CLI command to create DCA strategy:
```bash
dfx canister call up2ak-nqaaa-aaaap-qccia-cai  openPosition '(record { tokenToSell = principal "ryjl3-tyaaa-aaaaa-aaaba-cai"; tokenToBuy = principal "mxzaz-hqaaa-aaaar-qaada-cai"; beneficiary = principal "hfugy-ahqdz-5sbki-vky4l-xceci-3se5z-2cb7k-jxjuq-qidax-gd53f-nqe"; amountToSell = 30_000; frequency = variant {Daily} })' --ic
```

CLI result
```bash
(variant { ok = 0 : nat })
```

## Step 3. Wait some time and receive ckBTC
Right after creation, your position will be executed for the first time (usually it takes around 3 minutes). The date of the second purchase depends on the **frequency** field from the Position



## Local development

### Step 1. Deploying ICP Ledger and ckBTC Ledger

##### Edit deploy_local.sh to change DEFAULT_IDENTITY to your identity before run
```bash
bash scripts/deploy_local.sh
```
### Step 2. deploy **dca_backend** canister
```bash
1. dfx deploy dca_backend
```

### Step 3. Set Approve to DCA canister

```bash
dfx canister call ryjl3-tyaaa-aaaaa-aaaba-cai  icrc2_approve '(record { amount = 40_000; spender = record{owner = principal "up2ak-nqaaa-aaaap-qccia-cai";} })'
```

### Step 4. Creating a DCA strategy for swaping ICP to ckBTC
Change the **hfugy-ahqdz-5sbki-vky4l-xceci-3se5z-2cb7k-jxjuq-qidax-gd53f-nqe** to your principal id who will receive swap result

```bash
dfx canister call dca_backend openPosition '(record { tokenToSell = principal "ryjl3-tyaaa-aaaaa-aaaba-cai"; tokenToBuy = principal "mxzaz-hqaaa-aaaar-qaada-cai"; beneficiary = principal "hfugy-ahqdz-5sbki-vky4l-xceci-3se5z-2cb7k-jxjuq-qidax-gd53f-nqe"; amountToSell = 30_000; frequency = variant {Daily} })'
```
